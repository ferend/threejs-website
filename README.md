# THreeJS Personal Webpage
<h4>by Anderson Mancini</h4>


# Introduction

This is my three.js starter project.

Resources: [Threejs](https://threejs.org/), [WebGL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) , [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ ), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

# Getting Started
Download and install Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, open VSCODE, drag the project folder to it. Open VSCODE terminal and install dependencies (you need to do this only in the first time)
```
npm install
```

Run this command in your terminal to open a local server at localhost:8080
```
npm run dev
```

# Debug interface
You can enable a debug interface by getting the contents of "debug.js" file and place it in the end of the main file. This will give you some interface to change things like colors and light position, which can be very useful when you change the model to something else.


# Notes

I plan to add more functionality and features to this over time.
